1. File 0-5 means the working step for my project:
- 0Check_Stability: Checking the best paramaters for Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
- 1data_processing: After generating data from Metropolis.py from command line, here add the label data to the generated datasets.
- 2gen_model: Generating the CNN model.
- 3training: Training the CNN model and draw the loss curve and accuracy.
- 4training_improve: Training the regularized CNN model and draw the loss curve and accuracy.
- 5predicting: To calculate the accuracy by focusing on different type of temperature label.
- Metropolis.py: Generate datasets by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm 

2. the content of data folder:
- chk_points: storing the check points, which presents the epoch of best minimum loss for validation data.
- image: storing the images generated from all the .py file.
- model: storing the models.
- datasets(tooooo big so I can't upload.)
